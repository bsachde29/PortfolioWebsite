              <p></p>
                <p>
                  This project was completed under the guidance of Purdue University and has been my biggest project as of yet. In a team of
                  five, I and my peers undertook the challenge of creating a Shopify akin platform for mobile applications.

                  The major challenge our team faced was the technology. Not only did most of us not have much experience in building
                  websites (which would serve as an interface for sellers to manage their inventories), but none of us had ever made
                  a mobile app before. To sum our problems up, we had a period of about 2.5 months to learn the new technologies we
                  were working with, make TWO seperate platforms with their own servers and client sides and integrate both to the same
                  database. We ended up splitting the five person team into three parts: 2 dedicated members on the backend, 2 dedicated
                  members on the frontend, and 1 floater going back and forth between the other two teams. As the one with the most
                  knowledge of website development, I ended up taking on the role of floater and leader for the project.

                  I could go more into details about the other challenges by my team, and me individually as a leader, but I would
                  rather save that for a more personal conversation; likewise, feel free to contact me if you want to know more. In
                  the end though, my team and I pulled through after a long struggle to end up with a two-platform product that we
                  are all proud of.

              <h2>Project 2: Twitch Chat Bot(s)</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                  A longstanding source of entertainment for me has been gaming. In fact, I can attribute my entire interest in
                  CS arising from a Xbox360 that I recieved as a birthday gift in India. Accordingly, streaming services like
                  YouTube and Twitch have become a favorite second screen of mine while I am doing work. Chatbots have always
                  fascinated me and I consider them to be a vital experience of YouTube and Twitch chat. These past 6 months, I
                  decided to act on that fascination and work on two chatbots, with one serving as the knowledge basis for the other.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                  The first chatbot I worked on was a small personal project so that I could better understand the insides and outs
                  of how these work. After I had designed a wide variety of basic commands and was looking to experiment further, I
                  was approached by a moderator of a channel I frequently watch. The mod was working on a chatbot for the channel and
                  asked me if I want to be a part of its development. I was ecstatic because: 1) the scope of this second chatbot would
                  be much bigger than the first one, a fact that daunted and excited me simultaneously, and 2) the chatbot was, more or
                  less, at the same stage of development as the one I had been working on. Over the next few weeks, I pivoted to working
                  on the new chatbot and further optimized it alongside the moderator. Over the next few months, we added database
                  support, for which my background knowledge in MySQL and AWS came in handy for a fast and optimal implementation. We
                  anticipate that this chatbot will continue to grow and evolve alongside the needs of the channel and growth of Twitch's
                  API to better accomodate more viewers efficiently.

              <h2>Project 3: Making a Shell
              <p></p>
              <p>
                      Ah, Shell. A programmer's holy grail that gives you the flexibility that most file explorers could only dream of,
                      and the ability to run scripts that do the work for you. If I told you I was, in any way, prepared for the
                      challenge this project would prove to be and that it was an easy road because of my superior programming skills,
                      I would be lying. About the easy part. Nothing that I had done previously could prepare me for the information
                      overload this projec would end up being. Every second that I worked on the project was the most painful yet most
                      enjoyable second I had in coursework.
